# node-classification-methods-analysis

Part of master's degree.

Worked on analyisis of node classification techniques in graph machine learning. Tested on various datasets Node2Vec, GraphSAGE, GCN and GAT.


Here are some of the results:

- GAT accuracy 82.1% on CORA dataset - visualized with tSNE method:
